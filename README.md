# FIFA

This FIFA dataset contains 89 variables and 18207 rows. The size of the dataset is appropriate to meaningful analysis, and the variables include physical information (weight, height), skills (crossing, long shots), and financial information (value, wage). This dataset can help us better understand players’ strengths and weaknesses. There is a lot of analysis we can do with this dataset. For example, predicting players’ market value to see if a player is overrated/underrated. 

The first step is cleaning the data and doing normalization, so that it is easier for us to manage the data and understand attributes. Then, we analyze the value for key players by further exploring the data in python. The last step is to provide insights and actionable recommendations for our clients.
